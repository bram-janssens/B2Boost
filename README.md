Functions for the academic B2Boost study (currently under review and under active development).

The currently possible functions are:

EMPB_validation: validate using the EMPB metric developed for B2B churn

VerbrakenBoost: cost-sensitive extension of XGBoost which weights are based upon the EMPC measure from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165289.

B2Boost: instance-dependent cost-sensitive extension of XGBoost which weights are based upon the EMPB measure.
